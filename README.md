"This paper approaches the problem of finding shortest paths in the road network of Minneapolis by
using the search algorithm A* driven by differing heuristics to guide the search. This is important
to individuals using road networks in order to minimize their time spent either walking or driving
in the city as taking a shortest path reduces the resources spent such as energy or time to get from
one place to another. If the road network is already provided then the next step to finding the
shortest path using A* is to select a suitable version of it and heuristic that accommodates to a few
characteristics of the road map. The road map may differ in characteristics of size, being directed or
undirected depending on one-way roads and two-way roads, what method of transportation the map
is going to be used for such as walking, driving, or biking, and many other characteristics. The case
for Minneapolis road network provided will not taken into consideration the differing speed limits of
roads, however, it will take into consideration one-ways and two way roads. ...."
